    start: "Hello %{sender}! I'm Charkeeper - an electronic character sheet! I'll help you keep track of your characters that you play tabletop role-playing games with. You can find the mini-app launcher button at the bottom left.\nWhat I can do now: create characters according to D&D 5 and D&D 2024 rules, take into account equipment and known spells, display current racial and class abilities available to the character depending on the level, take into account spent spell slots, refresh available abilities after rest, display all possible attack abilities and help with keeping the character sheet in every possible way.\nI'm still in the process of development, you can send your comments, questions and suggestions to @kortirso."
