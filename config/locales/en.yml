    description: CharKeeper is absolutely free, but if you like using CharKeeper and would like to help with the development of the application, you can leave a small donation in one of the ways listed below. Now funds are only needed to pay for the domain name and hosting, but there are plans to pay for the work of enthusiasts who are filling the application with data from various role-playing systems, and to release CharKeeper on iOS (need to pay for an Apple developer account). I would be grateful for any help.
