    description: CharKeeper is absolutely free, but if you like using CharKeeper and would like to help with the development of the application, you can leave a small donation in one of the ways listed below. Now funds are only needed to pay for the domain name and hosting, but there are plans to pay for the work of enthusiasts who are filling the application with data from various role-playing systems, and to release CharKeeper on iOS (need to pay for an Apple developer account). I would be grateful for any help.

Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it."
        grapple: "You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure."
        jousting: When mounted, if you moved at least 10 feet on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value.
        monk: Many monks learn to use these weapons.
        nonlethal: Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.

        ranged_trip: "The weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill within the weapon's first range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty.

This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure."
        sweep: When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.
        thrown: You can throw this weapon as a ranged attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown.
        trip: "You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don't have a free hand. This uses the weapon's reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon's item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure."
        twin: "When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon's number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type, but they don't need to have the same runes."
        two_hand: "This weapon can be wielded with two hands to change its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon's damage dice."
